# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need to point at or near the pole?

No. In fact the plugin should work almost anywhere above your horizon. 

## Will this work in the southern hemisphere?

Yes.

## Does it account for refraction?

There is an option to enable this in the plugin page and it is currently under test.  
Keep in mind however that a *perfect* polar alignment is inherently difficult, due to constant changing atmosphere conditions, but the procedure will give you a good alignment with and without refraction corrections.

## How does the procedure work?

The procedure consists of the following steps  

* Step 1  
    + Slew to the specified alt/az coordinates - or start from current position
    + Start telescope tracking  
* Step 2  
    + Take an image of current position
    + Plate solve current position  
* Step 3  
    + Move the telescope by the [Move Rate] (automatic mode) or manually in East or West direction along the Right Ascension axis, based on [East Direction] setting until at least moved by [Target Distance]°
    + Take an image of current position
    + Plate solve current position  
* Step 4  
    + Move the telescope by the [Move Rate] (automatic mode) or manually in East or West direction along the Right Ascension axis, based on [East Direction] setting until at least moved by [Target Distance]°
    + Take an image of current position
    + Plate solve current position  
* Step 5  
    + Calculate the telescope axis out of the three points and compare it with the expected axis based on the user location  
* Step 6  
    + Continuously loop exposures, while tracking and plate solve them. Adjust the polar error according to the new solved result
    + The user should now adjust the altitude and azimuth of the mount during the loop until precise enough polar alignment is reached
    + By left clicking on a star, the visual indicators will follow the star for each incremental adjustment  
* Step 7  
    + Once the window is closed the instruction will finish and is complete

## What do I need for the procedure to run?

* Camera has to be connected and ready
* A goto mount that can move along the right ascension axis via its ASCOM driver has to be connected
  + Alternatively a manual mode can be enabled to manually move the mount along the right ascension axis
* Platesolving must be setup (Astrometry.NET is not supported as primary solver for this, as it is too slow)

## The mount and camera are both connected, but the button is greyed out to run it in auto mode, why?

* The automatic mode requires the mount to move along the right ascension axis. To achieve this a special method from ASCOM is used ["MoveAxis"](https://ascom-standards.org/Help/Platform/html/M_ASCOM_DeviceInterface_ITelescopeV3_MoveAxis.htm), which is different from standard slews.
* When the N E S W buttons in the telescope tab are greyed out the driver reports via ["CanMoveAxis"](https://ascom-standards.org/Help/Platform/html/M_ASCOM_DeviceInterface_ITelescopeV3_CanMoveAxis.htm) that the mount is incapable of using the "MoveAxis" method and thus making it impossible to run the automatic mode.
* Reach out to your mount vendor to enhance the driver (or for EQMOD users - disable strict conformance mode in the driver setup)  
* Until then you can use the **manual mode** instead

## How does manual mode work exactly?

The manual mode is targeted for mount drivers that can't use the MoveAxis command or can't connect to the application in general.  
For the manual mode to work properly follow these instructions:

1. If possible connect to your mount, so solving can have reference coordinates and does not need the blind solver. If you have no telescope connection, make sure your blind solver is setup.  
2. Enable the `Manual Mode` toggle  
3. Slew to the starting position where you want to start the polar alignment procedure  
4. Enable tracking of your mount  
5. Click start   
6. The polar alignment procedure will take the first measurement point.  
7. After the first point you will be asked to `Move the mount along Right Ascension (RA) axis`. The total amount of movement required will depend on your `Measure Point Distance` set   
8. During moving the mount, the polar alignment procedure will constantly solve and check how far you have already moved  
9. When moved enough for the second point the procedure will automatically transition to getting the third point. This third step will work exactly like step 6 & 7  
10. After moving enough for the third point, there is a 10 second cooldown period, where you should not move the mount any further. After this cooldown period the final point will be determined.  
11. Once all points are determined, the error adjustment will be displayed.  

## Is there a preferred direction to start the polar alignment process?

While the polar alignment in itself will work anywhere above your horizon, the further away you are from the celestial equator (which is at declination 0°) 
the less error prone the correction calculation will be, as things like tracking errors will be less pronounced then.  
There are also locations, that should be avoided due to geometrical constraints
  - pointing to azimuth exactly at 90° and 270° for the correction adjustments, as there the correction for altitude is impossible to calculate.
  - pointing directly to the zenith for the correction adjustments, as there the correction for azimuth is impossible to calculate.

## What does setting xyz do?

**Default [setting]**  
All settings starting with *default* are the initial settings where the values inside the instructions will be pre-populated from  
**Default Move Rate**  
The rate at which the telescope should be moved between points. Typically this is in degrees / seconds, but some mount vendors implement the move rate in a different way. If your mount differs from the expected rate, you might need to adjust the [*Axis move timeout factor*]  
**Default East Direction**  
Defines if the direction for the second and third point should be done by moving the mount in east or west direction along the RA axis  
*Hint: Some mount drivers need their primary axis move direction reversed inside the telescope tab*  
**Default Target Distance**  
The distance between measure points  
**Default Search Radius**  
As platesolving should be quick, this is the search radius that should be used for your plate solver. It should be larger than your initial error, but not too large to get quick solves.  
**Axis move timeout factor**  
After ([Measure Point Distance] / [Telescope Move Rate] * [Axis move timeout factor]) seconds, the mount will stop moving to the next point as a failsafe. Only increase this if you get warnings, that the [Measure Point Distance] was not reached  
**Default azimuth offset from pole**  
The azimuth offset in degrees from the pole position to start from for the first point  
**Default altitude offset from pole**  
The altitude offset in degrees from the pole position to start from for the first point  
**Polar Alignment Tolerance**
Setting this value to non-zero will specify a tolerance in arcminutes where the polar alignment routine automatically completes when below the threshold
**Various Error Colors**  
Here you can adjust the error colors for the guide numbers that will show you the error amount  
**Log polar alignment error adjustments**  
When this is enabled, a log file will be created at `\Documents\N.I.N.A\TPPA` and filled with the polar alignment error and the continuous errors after adjustments.  
**Adjust for refraction**  
When this is enabled, the application will factor in refraction based on your location, elevation and current weather conditions.  
If no weather source is connected a [standard parameter set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_temperature_and_pressure) for pressure (1013.25HPa), humidity (0%) and temperature (15°C) is used instead.  
**Stop Tracking when done?**  
Disable this setting if you want your mount to continue tracking after the polar alignment is finished  
**Use Avalon Polar Alignment System?**  
This requires the [Avalon Universal Polar Alignment System](https://www.avalon-instruments.com/products-menu/accessories/universal-polar-alignment-system-detail) being connected to your system  
When activated, the polar alignment routine will connect to the unit automatically after the third step, allowing you to remotely adjust the altitude and azimuth of your system.  
**X axis backlash compensation**  
The amount of steps to overshoot when a change in direction happens. Set to 0 to disable.  
**Do automated adjustments?**  
Requires `Use Avalon Polar Alignment System?` to be turned on.  
When activated, this will connect to the UPA and slowly nudge the UPA to the target position automatically after the error has been determined. The control panel will not be shown as movements are done automatically.  
Ensure your calibration factor settings are roughly matched so that one step in the UPA results in an arcminute of movement. The default settings should work fine for the standard version of the UPA.  
Make sure your mount is roughly leveled.  
*Note: For this setting to work, you also need to set the `Polar Alignment Tolerance` to a non-zero value.*  
**Automated adjustment settle time**  
Requires `Do automated adjustments?` to be turned on.   
Specifies the amount of time after each movement to wait.

## The solver keeps failing, even though solving works in other places. How can I fix this?

To speed up the solving process, TPPA has a separate setting for the solver [Search Radius]. This value has to be higher than your polar alignment and pointing error combined, otherwise the solve will fail. 
Increase this setting in case you are not able to solve successfully during TPPA, but solving is working in other places.

## Do I need the guider or the main imaging camera for this to work?

All you need to have is a camera that can be connected to N.I.N.A. and correct settings for your focal length and camera pixel size.
In addition to that you need a plate solver setup (ASTAP is recommended here) to work with the combination.

## Do I need a goto mount?

With the plugin version 1.3.0.0 and above there is a toggle for "manual mode". There the mount will not be controlled, but instead the users needs to move the mount by themselves.  
The polar alignment will then start on the current position and will tell you when to move the mount to the second and third point. Ideally you enable tracking for the whole procedure.

## How do I start the polar alignment?

There are two ways to start it. From within an advanced sequence and directly inside the imaging tab.  
**Inside advanced sequence**: Just drag the `Three Point Polar Alignment` instruction to the location inside your advanced sequence where you think it will fit best. Once the instruction is executed a new window will appear that will guide you through the process.  
**From imaging tab**: Open the panel from the available tools on the top right corner. A new panel will appear that will guide you through the process.

## My error keeps changing when not adjusting anything. Why?

The routine relies on the mount to be tracking and any change of the frame will be added to the error corrections.  
When the mount is not aligned or just ran through some periodic error it will not track perfectly and therefore some error margin will be introduced.  
As already stated above, don't worry about a few arcseconds of error. If it takes a long time for you to dial in the alignment you can also restart the alignment routine to recalculate the initial error and fine tune the alignment further.

## What is the size of the target circle?

The circle size will be rendered based on your image scale and there will be circles drawn at 30 arcseconds, 1 arcminute and 5 arcminutes.

## Are there any areas in the sky which I should avoid? 
- Meridian
- Direction exactly towards east (90°) or west (270°)
- Zenith
- Low Altitude
- Avoid crossing the meridian during the 3 point slews and adjustments

(For southern hemisphere the ideal zones are due south)
