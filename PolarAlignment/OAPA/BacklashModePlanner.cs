    /// on the requested target (Soft deliberately trades up to B/4 of that for safety
    /// against an overestimated value).
    ///
    /// The play is configured per direction, because entering one direction and entering
    /// the other are two different physical quantities: an axis carrying its load against
    /// gravity crosses its own play unaided one way and has to be driven across it the
    /// other, so the two can differ several-fold on the same axis. Every leg is therefore
    /// compensated with the value of the direction *that leg* travels, which is what makes
    /// a two-leg plan land exactly: the overshoot leg pays one transition and the return
    /// leg pays the other, and they cancel only when each is given its own number. Passing
    /// one value for both directions reproduces the symmetric behaviour exactly.
    ///
    /// The cost of that exactness is a sharp dependence on the *difference* between the two
    /// numbers, which the single-value form does not have. A Unidirectional plan commands a
    /// net travel of <c>move - outward + back</c>; the missing part is supposed to be eaten
    /// by real play, so if the mechanism's play is smaller than configured, the gap between
    /// the pair lands as a fixed bias on every reversal. It follows that the axis cannot be
    /// corrected by less than that gap, and that requests below it move the axis the *wrong
    /// way*. Two field rigs stalled at exactly their configured gap, 9.3' and 7.3'. A wrong
    /// difference is therefore worse than a wrong average, and the pair must only be split
    /// when the difference is established - which is what the calibration's directionality
    /// verdict decides before the values ever reach here.
